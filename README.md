# MinimalOBJHTMLViewer

This repository contains a simple 3D OBJ+MTL viewer using a single ```<div class="three_viewer">...</div>``` wrapper.

For short, the viewer creates a simple [three.js](threejs.org) context you can easily custom. Please have a look to the [index.html](index.html) file for details.


These scripts were designed by [Pierre Gueth](https://github.com/elcerdo) to be able to visualize [DGtal](http://dgtal.org) objects within HTML (working with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) as well).
