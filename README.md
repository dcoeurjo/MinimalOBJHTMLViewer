# MinimalOBJHTMLViewer

This repository contains a simple 3D OBJ+MTL viewer using a single ```<div class="three_viewer">...</div>``` wrapper.

For short, the viewer creates a simple [threejs.org](three.js) context you can easily custom. Please have a look to the index.html file for details.


These scripts were desigend by Pierre Gueth to be able to visualize DGtal objects within HTML.
